[b][b]What Have You Created????[/b][/b]
I am really bad at counting on Minecraft and often end up with rooms that are the wrong
dimensions, walls that do not line up and various other irritating problems. Sometimes all I wanted was 
some help to show me the center blocks or a line on the screen to show me I was still aligned.

So along came Builder's Guides, inspired partly by OpenBlocks Builders Guide block. Granted
mine is IN NO WAY as fancy as theirs.

So this mod provides you with a collection of cheap marker blocks, that will help you in your
building endeavours.

Of course if you do not want to see the guide lines on the screen, go to the config file and disable
the client rendering.

And no, I am not proud of the textures!
