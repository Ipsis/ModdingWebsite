[b][b]What Is It???[/b][/b]
I hate finding and combining dyes, so this is my answer.
Squeeze all those flowers into liquid dyes and store them for future use.
Then you can fill up your dye gun and start painting world blocks.
Eg. Have a wall made of one color of wool or stained clay? Just get the dye gun out and start dying the wool/clay.

So the basic steps are:
* Build yourself a squeezer and mixer to turn all your flowers and dye drops into pure dye
* Use the pure dye to
** Stamp out new dyes
** Mass produce painted blocks
** Fill up your dye gun and start painting.

You can squeeze anything that can be shapeless crafted into a dye.

You can paint both vanilla and modded blocks.
Modded blocks can be configured via a json file.

[b][b]Technical Bit[/b][/b]
This mod uses the fact that a lot of colored world blocks use the metadata value to deterime the color.
Not all mods uses this method. So we are restricted to only allow blocks to be painted where their metadata value is used.
There json config file will allow you to swap block and metadata for each color, so can handle Chisel.

[b][b]Disclaimer[/b][/b]
It says beta for a reason.
This is a work in progress mod and can (will?) crash.
For one it has multiblock structures and we know how fun they are.
Testing has been limited to using it with the latest FTB DireWorlf20 pack in single player.
