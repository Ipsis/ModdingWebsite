[b][b]What Is It???[/b][/b]
I hate finding and combining dyes, so this is my answer.
Squeeze all those flowers into liquid dyes and store them for future use.

So the basic steps are:
* Build yourself a squeezer and mixer to turn all your flowers and dye drops into pure dye
* Use the pure dye to
** Stamp out new dyes
** Mass produce painted blocks
** Fill up your dye gun

You can squeeze anything (hopefully) that can be manually crafted into a dye.

[b][b]Disclaimer[/b][/b]
It says beta for a reason.
This is a work in progress mod and can (will?) crash.
For one it has multiblock structures and we know how fun they are.
Testing has been limited to using it with the latest FTB DireWorlf20 pack in single player.
